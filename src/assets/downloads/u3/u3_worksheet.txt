Discussion Questions:

Unit 3 Discussion Post 1: There are 16 Stigs that involve PAM for RHEL 9. Read the guide
from Rocky Linux here: https://docs.rockylinux.org/guides/security/pam/
1. What are the mechanisms and how do they affect PAM functionality?
    a. Review /etc/pam.d/sshd on a Linux system, what is happening in that file
       relative to these functionalities?

2. What are the common PAM modules?
    a. Review /etc/pam.d/sshd on a Linux system, what is happening in that file
       relative to these functionalities?

3. Look for a blog post or article about PAM that discusses real world application. Post
   it here and give us a quick synopsis. (Bonus arbitrary points if you find one of our
   ProLUG members blogs on the subject.)

Unit 3 Discussion Post 2: Read about active directory (or LDAP) configurations of Linux via
sssd here:
https://docs.rockylinux.org/guides/security/authentication/active_directory_authentication/
1. Why do we not want to just use local authentication in Linux? Or really any system?
2. There are 4 SSSD STIGS.
    a. What are they?
    b. What do they seek to do with the system?
