        <h1>Unit 1 - Build Standards and Compliance</h1>
    </p>
</div>

## Overview

Building standards and compliance in cybersecurity engineering ensures that
systems adhere to industry best practices, regulatory requirements, and
security frameworks, reducing risks and vulnerabilities.

By implementing structured guidelines through tools and frameworks like STIGs
(Security Technical Implementation Guides) and the NIST CS (National Institute
of Standards and Technology Cyber Security) framework, organizations can maintain
resilience against evolving threats while ensuring accountability and regulatory alignment.

This chapter will present critical knowledge in implementing security controls in
information systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Unit 1 students will have foundational knowledge and skills of
the concepts below:

1. Security Frameworks such as STIGs, CIS Controls, NIST Cybersecurity Framework
2. Regulatory Compliance and Industry Standards when administering and building systems
3. Skills and concepts in interacting with STIG remediation processes
4. Understanding Risk Management and concepts surrounding risk vectors to organizations
5. STIG Remediation and documentation skills

## Relevance & Context

As the shepherds of sensitive data and systems, it is the ethical and legal duty of individuals
that administer and build these systems to protect them from malicious actors with no regard for
propriety. To be successful in securing systems students will need to thoroughly understand the
cybersecurity landscape, its myriad potential threats, and the tools engineers and administrators
have at their disposal.

The concepts presented in this unit play a pivotal role in organizing and structuring a resilient security
posture against threats to enterprise and organizational entities. They provide processes and procedures
that engineers and administrators can implement to significantly reduce the attack surface of the systems
they administer along with building a system of logging and documentation in the eventuality of a security
incident.

By thoroughly understanding these concepts students will be armed with a set of tools in the eternal and
ever evolving landscape of cybersecurity.

## Prerequisites

Students should have a strong understanding of such skills as presented
in the Linux Administration Course including:

1. The Command Line Interface and BASH shell skills
2. Installing and Updating Linux System Packages
3. Interacting with command line tools such as: `systemctl`, `mount`, `grep`, and `ss`
4. Ability to interact with basic SQL queries using MariaDB
5. Students will need to download the latest STIG viewer, v2.18
