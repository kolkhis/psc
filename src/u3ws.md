#### Discussion Post #1

There are 16 Stigs that involve PAM for RHEL 9.
Read the guide from Rocky Linux here: <https://docs.rockylinux.org/guides/security/pam/>

1. What are the mechanisms and how do they affect PAM functionality?
   - Review `/etc/pam.d/sshd` on a Linux system.  
     What is happening in that file relative to these functionalities?
2. What are the common PAM modules?
   - Review `/etc/pam.d/sshd` on a Linux system.  
     What is happening in that file relative to these functionalities?
3. Look for a blog post or article about PAM that discusses real world application.  
   Post it here and give us a quick synopsis. (Bonus arbitrary points if you find one of our ProLUG members blogs on the subject.)

#### Discussion Post #2

Read about active directory (or LDAP) configurations of Linux via `sssd` here:
<https://docs.rockylinux.org/guides/security/authentication/active_directory_authentication>

1. Why do we not want to just use local authentication in Linux? Or really any system?
2. There are 4 SSSD STIGS.
   - What are they?
   - What do they seek to do with the system?

## Digging Deeper

1. How does `/etc/security/access.conf` come into play with pam_access?
   Read up on it here: <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam_access.8.html>
   - Can you find any other good resources?
   - What is the structure of the access.conf file directives?
2. What other important user access or user management information do you learn by
   reading this? <https://docs.rockylinux.org/books/admin_guide/06-users/>
   - What is the contents of the `/etc/login.defs` file? Why do you care?
