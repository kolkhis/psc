### Required Materials

Putty or other connection tool Lab Server  
Root or sudo command access  
STIG Viewer 2.18 (download from <https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/>)

#### Downloads

The lab has been provided below. The document(s) can be transposed to
the desired format so long as the content is preserved. For example, the `.docx`
could be transposed to a `.md` file.

- <a href="./assets/downloads/u2/u2_lab.txt" target="_blank" download>ðŸ“¥ u2_lab(`.txt`)</a>
- <a href="./assets/downloads/u2/u2_lab.docx" target="_blank" download>ðŸ“¥ u2_lab(`.docx`)</a>

## Pre-Lab Warm-Up

---

**EXERCISES** (Warmup to quickly run through your system and familiarize yourself)

```bash
sysctl -a | grep -i ipv4 | grep -i forward
# Does this system appear to be set to forward? Why or why not?

sysctl -a | grep -i ipv4 | grep -i martian
# What are martians and is this system allowing them?

sysctl -a | grep -i panic
# How does this system handle panics?

sysctl -a | grep -i crypto
# What are the settings you see? Is FIPS enabled?

cat /proc/cmdline
fips-mode-setup --check
sestatus
cat /etc/selinux/config
```

What information about the security posture of the system can you see here?  
Can you verify SELINUX status?  
Can you verify FIPS status?

Download the STIG Viewer 2.18 from - <https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/>

## Lab ðŸ§ª

---

This lab is designed to have the engineer practice securing a Linux server or service against a set of configuration standards. These standards are sometimes called benchmarks, checklists, or guidelines. The engineer will be using STIG Viewer 2.18 to complete this lab.

### Network Service configuration

Connect to a hammer server  
Filter by ipv4 and see how many STIGs you have.

<img src="./assets/downloads/u2/image5.jpeg"></img>

#### Examine STIG V-257957

What is the problem?  
What is the fix?  
What type of control is being implemented?  
Is it set properly on your system?

```bash
sysctl -a | grep -i ipv4 | grep -i syncookies
```

<img src="./assets/downloads/u2/image6.png"></img>

Can you remediate this finding?  
In this case it's already correctly set.  
But if we needed to, we would set that value in /etc/sysctl.d/00- remediate.conf  
And then reload sysctl with `sysctl --system`

#### Check and remediate V-257958 STIG

What is the problem?  
What is the fix?  
What type of control is being implemented?  
Is it set properly on your system?

<img src="./assets/downloads/u2/image7.png"></img>

How would you go about remediating this on your system?

#### Check and remediate V-257960 and V-257961 STIGs

What is the problem? How are they related?  
What is the fix?  
What type of control is being implemented?  
Is it set properly on your system?

#### Filter by firewall

How many STIGS do you see?

<img src="./assets/downloads/u2/image8.jpeg"></img>

What do these STIGS appear to be trying to do? What types of controls are they?

### Firewall port exposure

Scenario:

<blockquote>

Your team needs to use node_exporter with Prometheus to allow scraping of system information
back to your network monitoring solution. You are running a firewall, so you need to expose
the port that node_exporter runs on to the network outside of your system.

</blockquote>

#### Expose a network port through your firewall

```bash
# Verify that your firewall is running
systemctl status firewalld

# Verify that your firewall has the service defined
firewall-cmd --get-services | grep -i node
ls /usr/lib/firewalld/services | grep -i node

# Verify that the service is not currently enabled for node_exporter
firewall-cmd --list-services

# Examine the structure of the firewall .xml file
cat /usr/lib/firewalld/services/prometheus-node-exporter.xml

# Enable the service through your firewall
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=prometheus-node-exporter

# Reload so the changes take effect
firewall-cmd --reload

# Verify that the service is currently enabled for node_exporter
firewall-cmd --list-services
```

### Automate STIG remediation on a system

There are many options and the STIG remediation steps are well known. Here the learner
will examine a few ways to generate Ansible and Shell fixes to your system. Then one can
apply all of them, or just some of them. This is the real value of a security engineer
focused Linux engineer, the trade-off between security and productivity.

#### Download and extract a STIG remediation tool

<div class="warning">
<strong>Note</strong>: If any lab download does not work, check the <code>/labs</code> folder on the server for a <code>[course]_[unit#].zip</code> file to complete the activities.
</div>

```bash
cd /root
mkdir stigs
cd stigs
wget -O U_RHEL_9_V2R4_STIG_Ansible.zip https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/stigs/zip/U_RHEL_9_V2R4_STIG_Ansible.zip
unzip U_RHEL_9_V2R4_STIG_Ansible.zip
mkdir ansible
cp rhel9STIG-ansible.zip ansible/
cd ansible
unzip rhel9STIG-ansible.zip
```

#### Examine the default values for STIGS

```bash
cd /root/stigs/ansible/roles/rhel9STIG/defaults/
vim main.yml
```

Search for a few of the STIG numbers you used earlier and see their default values.

- use /257784 to search

#### Examine the playbook to see how those are applied in a running system.

```bash
vim /root/stigs/ansible/roles/rhel9STIG/tasks/main.yml
```

- use /257784 to search for the STIG from above and see how it is fixed in the playbook.

#### Create an Ansible playbook from OpenSCAP

```bash
dnf -y install openscap-scanner openscap-utils openscap-scanner scap-security-guide
cd /root
mkdir openscap
cd openscap

# Generate the Ansible
oscap xccdf generate fix --profile ospp --fix-type ansible /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel9-ds.xml > draft-disa-remediate.yml

# Examine the file
vim draft-disa-remediate.yml

# Generate a BASH version
oscap xccdf generate fix --profile ospp --fix-type bash /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel9-ds.xml > draft-disa-remediate.sh

# Examine the file
vim draf-disa-remediate.sh
```

> Be sure to `reboot` the lab machine from the command line when you are done.
