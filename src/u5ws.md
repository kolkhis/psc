#### Discussion Post #1

Review the rocky documentation on Software management in
Linux. 

- <https://docs.rockylinux.org/books/admin_guide/13-softwares/>

1. What do you already understand about the process?
2. What new things did you learn or pick up?
3. What are the DNF plugins?
    What is the use of the versionlock plugin?
4. What is an EPEL?
    Why do you need to consider this when using one?

#### Discussion Post #2

Do a google search for ‚Äúpatching enterprise Linux‚Äù and try to
wade through all of the noise.

1. What blogs (or AI) do you find that enumerates a list of steps or checklists to
consider?
2. After looking at that, how does patching a fleet of systems in the enterprise differ
from pushing ‚Äúupdate now‚Äù on your local desktop?
    What seems to be the major considerations?
    What seems to be the major roadblocks?

## Digging Deeper

1. After completing the lab and worksheet, draw out how you would deploy a software
repository into your system.
    How are you going to update it?
    What tools do you find that are useful in this space?

## Reflection Questions

---

1. Why is it that repos are controlled by root/admin functions and not any user,
developer, or manager?

2. What questions do you still have about this week?

3. How are you going to use what you've learned in your current role?
