#### Discussion Post #1

Read about configuration management here:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management>

- What overlap of terms and concepts do you see from this week’s meeting?

- What are some of the standards and guidelines organizations involved with
  configuration management?

  - Do you recognize them from other IT activities?

#### Discussion Post #2

Review the SRE guide to treating configurations as code.  
Read as much as you like, but focus down on the “Practical Advice” section:
<https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/ch14.html#treat_configuration_as_code>

- What are the best practices that you can use in your configuration management adherence?

- What are the security threats and how can you mitigate them?

- Why might it be good to know this as you design a CMDB or CI/CD pipeline?
