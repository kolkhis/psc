# Example Lab from Unit 1 of LAC

---

# PART 1 - Linux File Operations

## Module 1: Creating Empty Files

### Exercise 1.1: Familiarizing ourselves with the System
```bash
mount | grep -i noexec

mount | grep -i nodev

mount | grep -i nosuid

# Approximately how many of your mounted filesystems have each of these values?
```

### Exercise 1.2: Checking Mounted Systems

```bash
sysctl -a | grep -i ipv4

sysctl -a | grep -i ipv6

# How many of each are there?
```

```bash
sysctl -a | grep -i ipv4 | grep -i forward

# Does IPv4 forward on interfaces?
```

```bash
lsmod | grep -i tables
# What type of tables exist?
```

## Module 2: PreLAB

1. Download the STIG Viewer 2.18 from - https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/
2. Download the STIG for Mariadb and the import it into your STIG viewer

## Module 3: Lab

This lab is designed to have the engineer practice securing a Linux server or service against a set of configuration standards. These standards are sometimes called benchmarks, checklists, or guidelines. The engineer will be using STIG Viewer 2.18 to complete this lab.

### MariaDB Service configuration:

1. Connect to a hammer server
2. Install MariaDB

```bash
dnf install mariadb-server

# Ensure that it is running

systemctl start mariadb

systemctl status mariadb

ss -ntulp | grep 3306

Check and remediate v-253666 STIG

- What is the problem?
- What is the fix?
- What type of control is being implemented?
- Is it set properly on your system?

```

```mysql
# Connect to `mariadb` locally

SELECT user, max_user_connections FROM mysql.user;

# Can you remediate this finding?
```
