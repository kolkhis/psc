        <h1>Unit 1 Worksheet - Linux Fundamentals and Systems Editing Tools</h1>
    </p>
</div>

Welcome to Unit 1 of the Professional Linux Users Group (ProLUG) Systems Administration Course.
With this worksheet students will explore the foundations of Linux and its many constituent parts.

Specifically, this unit and worksheet aim to cover concepts such as the command line interface (CLI),
commands and syntax, command line tools, Vim (visual editor improved), the Linux Kernel, and much more.

Students are strongly encouraged to learn from these units and apply what they learn. Applying what you
learn offers no better teacher. Again welcome, and good luck in your studies.

## Instructions

A major aspect of this course is to intake, comprehend, and discuss the assigned
topics. Take the time to fully absorb each topic and contribute to the discussion
thread by sharing your thoughts. Interaction with peers is also expected; the goal is
to compare and contrast ideas to build a solid foundation of knowledge.

Fill out this worksheet as you watch the unit video.
Discussion posts can be completed afterwards, answers to be posted in Discord.
You must both answer the discussion questions and respond to another student's
answers. This is only required if you want the certification.
