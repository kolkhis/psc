## Instructions

---

A major aspect of this course is to intake, comprehend, and discuss the assigned
topics. Take the time to fully absorb each topic and contribute to the discussion
thread by sharing your thoughts. Interaction with peers is also expected; the goal is
to compare and contrast ideas to build a solid foundation of knowledge.

Fill out this worksheet as you watch the unit video.
Discussion posts can be completed afterwards, answers to be posted in Discord.
You must both answer the discussion questions and respond to another student's
answers. This is only required if you want the certification.

#### Discussion Post #1

The first question of this course is, “What is Security?”

1. Describe the CIA Triad.
2. What is the relationship between Authority, Will, and Force as they relate to security?

#### Discussion Post #2

Find a STIG or compliance requirement that you do not agree is necessary for a server or service build.

1. What is the STIG or compliance requirement trying to do?
2. What category and type of control is it?
