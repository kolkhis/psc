## 🚧 Currently Under Development 🚧

# The Professional Linux Users Group (ProLUG) Systems Security Course Book

Current deployment: <https://professionallinuxusersgroup.github.io/psc/>

## Goals

The overarching goal of this project is to provide a free, open source Systems Administration course
predicated on the work produced by Scott Champine, an experienced and skilled Senior Systems Engineer.

Scott has over 20+ years administering and engineering Linux systems across a broad variety of
fields and teams. He has built and maintains systems like High Performance Compute (HPC) clusters
for [NOAA (The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)](https://www.noaa.gov/) and more.

ProLUG looks forward to working with contributors who want to give back to the community and produce
skilled Systems Administrators and Systems enthusiasts.

## Objectives

Contributors will be tasked with developing templated course material provided by Scott Champine.
Outlined below are a set of objectives this repository attempts to provide.

- Provide a centralized set of worksheets and labs for prospective learners to begin understanding Systems Security.
- Deliver templated versions of course work per unit along with supplementary material and video.
- Provide learners with foundational knowledge in computer systems to include:
  - Security Frameworks:
    - CIS (Center for Internet Security) Benchmarks
    - STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guides) Tools
    - PCI/DSS (Payment Compliance & Diplomatic Security Service) Compliances
  - Basic to Advanced System Security:
    - Networks; Ports, Firewalls
    - User Access; LDAP, Vaults, Cloud Procedures
    - Update and Patch cycles; Pre-Checks, Deploying, Testing
    - Bastions and Airgaps
    - Change Management
    - Configuration drift and remediation
  - Monitoring:
    - Alert management; Prometheus
    - Tools and Techniques; rsyslog, Promtail, Splunk Forwarder
  - Certificates and Key Management
    - NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Best practices

## To Begin Contributing

ProLUG asks all contributors to understand and adhere to the principles and guidelines detailed
in the [contributing.md](https://github.com/ProfessionalLinuxUsersGroup/psc/blob/main/src/contributing.md) markdown file.
Contributors found significantly deviating from these policies will have their work discarded appropriately.

Contributors will be provided with supplementary material to begin building out unit worksheet labs
and templates within the project managed issues board.
